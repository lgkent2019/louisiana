<h3>Jambalaya</h3>

<p>
The jambalaya I make has a tomato sauce base. It contains sausage, green bell
peppers, and onions. After I make the sauce I combine it with the cooked rice. 
My family loves this recipe and it makes enough to enjoy leftovers the next day 
or share with others.

<p>
 I use a roux to start my gumbo. A roux is a mix of oil and flour sauteed to the
 desired color of the roux. After that I add water, chicken and onions. After the 
 chicken is cooked, I add the sausage and vegetables. I usually use green bell
 peppers, okra, and other seasonings in my gumbo. I serve it over rice. This is
 perfect for a cold winter day.

<p>
I have never made beignets from scratch although I've always wanted to try it. 
I did grow up eating them and have hadthe privledge of sharing this amazing 
dessert with my midwestern family. There are many recipes online as well as 
box mixes.
